- Three scripts in a chain to get model response, model-response evaluation by rubric, 
    - `run_api.py`: get response from Gemini-2.5 model, generate structured json output
    - `score_outputs_stub`: evaluate model responses according to the rubric
    - `pair_stub.py`: make the model evaluation pairwise
